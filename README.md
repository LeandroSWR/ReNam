# RēˈNām
A file renamer to help with mass renaming of files.

This is a work in progress. Bellow i'll list a few of the features i'm aming to implement:

- Allow folder drop-in to get all the file names
- Rule based renamer, allow adding rules to rename the files droped in
- Plex renamer, allow you to search a series/movie to get the names of all the episodes in that series that can then be used to rename your files (Kind of like filebot).

This will take awile and during the development process i'd like you to share any ideas you have to improve the app :)

The first release will be barebones only having the drop-in for folders and a rule based renamer.
